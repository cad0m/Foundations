## Skills Developed

- **Python Programming**: Syntax, built-in functions, control structures
- **Data Structures**: Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
- **File Operations**: Reading/writing files, working with CSV files
- **Error Handling**: Try/except blocks, custom exceptions
- **Regular Expressions**: Pattern matching and text processing
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, encapsulation
- **Testing**: Unit testing with pytest, test-driven development
- **Libraries**: Using and integrating external Python packages
- **Data Validation**: Input verification, data cleaning
- **Software Architecture**: Building complete applications

## Key Takeaways

CS50P provided a comprehensive introduction to Python programming, building on concepts from CS50x but with a focus on Python's specific features and programming paradigms. The course structure progressively introduced concepts, with each week building on previous knowledge.

The final project allowed me to demonstrate all the skills acquired throughout the course in a single cohesive application. This course solidified my understanding of Python as a versatile language for various applications, from data processing to web development.
