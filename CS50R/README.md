# CS50R: Introduction to Data Science with R

This directory contains my work for Harvard's CS50R: Introduction to Data Science with R course. I've completed the first two weeks and plan to continue with the remainder of the course.

## Course Structure & My Progress

| Week | Topic | Status | Key Concepts | Projects |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|----------|
| 0 | Introduction to R | âœ… | R Basics, Data Types, Functions | [Week 0 Exercises](./Week0_Introduction) |
| 1 | Data Visualization | âœ… | ggplot2, Data Visualization Principles | [Week 1 Exercises](./Week1_DataVisualization) |
| 2 | Data Wrangling | ðŸ”œ Planned | dplyr, tidyr, Data Transformation | Not started |
| 3 | Data Modeling | ðŸ”œ Planned | Statistical Analysis, Linear Regression | Not started |
| 4 | Text Mining | ðŸ”œ Planned | Text Processing, NLP Basics | Not started |
| 5 | Machine Learning | ðŸ”œ Planned | Classification, Clustering | Not started |
| 6 | Interactive Dashboards | ðŸ”œ Planned | Shiny, Interactive Visualizations | Not started |
| 7 | Geospatial Analysis | ðŸ”œ Planned | Mapping, Spatial Statistics | Not started |
| Final Project | Data Analysis | ðŸ”œ Planned | All concepts combined | Not started |

## Skills Developed So Far

- **R Programming Fundamentals**: Variables, functions, data types, control structures
- **Data Import/Export**: Reading and writing various file formats (CSV, Excel, etc.)
- **Data Visualization**: Creating effective visualizations with ggplot2
- **R Environment**: RStudio, package management, Markdown reports
- **Statistical Concepts**: Basic statistical operations and analysis

## Learning Goals

As I continue with CS50R, I aim to develop proficiency in:
1. **Data Wrangling**: Efficiently manipulating and cleaning data with the tidyverse
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to derive insights
3. **Machine Learning in R**: Implementing predictive models
4. **Data Communication**: Creating compelling data stories and visualizations
5. **Reproducible Research**: Writing clean, documented R code and reports

## Key Takeaways

Though I've only completed the first two weeks, CS50R has already provided valuable insights into data analysis with R. The course's hands-on approach has helped me understand how to transform raw data into meaningful visualizations and insights. I'm excited to continue building these skills as I progress through the remainder of the course.

R's specialized focus on statistical computing and data analysis complements my programming knowledge from the other CS50 courses, particularly Python, giving me a broader toolkit for tackling various data-related challenges.
