## Skills Developed

- **SQL Fundamentals**: Writing effective queries with SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, etc.
- **Database Design**: Creating normalized database schemas, understanding relationships
- **Performance Optimization**: Indexing, query tuning, execution plans
- **Data Integrity**: Constraints, foreign keys, triggers, transactions
- **Views and Abstraction**: Creating views for security and simplicity
- **Data Analysis**: Using SQL for analytical queries and reporting
- **Database Administration**: Understanding database maintenance and management
- **Multiple SQL Dialects**: Experience with SQLite and exposure to other SQL variants
- **Entity-Relationship Modeling**: Designing databases from conceptual models

## Key Takeaways

CS50SQL has given me a thorough understanding of relational databases and SQL. The course covered not just how to write queries, but also the principles of good database design, optimization, and management. The progression from basic queries to complex database applications provided a comprehensive education in database systems.

For my final project, I'm planning to create a [brief description of your planned final project]. This will demonstrate my ability to design and implement a complete database application, incorporating all the concepts learned throughout the course.
