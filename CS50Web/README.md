## Learning Approach

Throughout CS50 Web, I've focused on understanding both the theoretical concepts and their practical applications:
1. **Study**: Learn the frameworks and technologies
2. **Practice**: Implement the concepts in progressive assignments
3. **Explore**: Experiment with additional features beyond the requirements
4. **Review**: Refactor code and improve implementations based on lessons learned

## Next Steps

I plan to continue with the remaining weeks of CS50 Web, focusing on:
1. Completing the JavaScript section
2. Learning React for building more complex front-end applications
3. Understanding testing and deployment methodologies
4. Building a comprehensive final project that showcases all the skills learned
