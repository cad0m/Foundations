## Skills Developed

- **Programming Fundamentals**: Variables, loops, conditionals, functions, arrays
- **Memory Management**: Understanding pointers, heap vs. stack, memory allocation
- **Algorithmic Thinking**: Time complexity, space complexity, algorithm design
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, linked lists, hash tables, tries
- **Software Engineering**: Debugging, code organization, modular design
- **Multiple Languages**: C, Python, SQL, JavaScript basics
- **Problem-Solving**: Breaking down complex problems, implementing solutions

## Learning Approach

Throughout CS50x, I followed a structured approach:
1. **Watch** the lecture videos and take notes
2. **Understand** the problem sets and their requirements
3. **Plan** my solution approach before coding
4. **Implement** the solution, focusing on correctness first
5. **Refactor** to improve code quality and efficiency
6. **Debug** to fix any issues and learn from mistakes

## Key Takeaways

CS50x provided me with a strong foundation in computer science principles. The progression from C to higher-level languages gave me a deep understanding of how computers work at different levels of abstraction. The problem sets challenged me to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems.

When I encountered Python in Week 6, I decided to pursue the dedicated CS50 Python course to deepen my knowledge, which led me to explore other specialized CS50 courses.
