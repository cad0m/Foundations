# My CS50 Journey & Personal Projects

Over the past months, I've immersed myself in Harvard/edX's CS50 courses and supplemented my learning with personal projects. This journey has helped me build a strong foundation in computer science, programming, and web development. Below is an overview of my progress and key projects:

## üîç Learning Approach

My learning journey follows a pattern:
1. **Discover** new concepts in CS50x
2. **Dive deeper** by taking specialized CS50 courses on those topics
3. **Apply** knowledge through personal projects
4. **Refine** skills by iterating on projects and assignments

## üí° Key Skills Developed

- **Programming Languages**: C, Python, SQL, JavaScript, R (basics)
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, Responsive Design
- **Computer Science Fundamentals**: Data Structures, Algorithms, Memory Management
- **Database Design**: SQL, Data Modeling
- **Problem Solving**: Algorithmic Thinking, Debugging, Testing

## üìà Future Learning Goals

- Complete CS50 SQL final project
- Continue CS50 Web beyond JavaScript
- Expand CS50 R knowledge
- Build more complex personal projects incorporating backend functionality
